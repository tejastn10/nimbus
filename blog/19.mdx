  A hands-on journey from DevOps convenience to deep technical curiosity ‚Äî exploring how SSH works under the hood, and why remote access and port forwarding feel like quiet superpowers.
about: Network
---

_When I took over DevOps responsibilities at my current company, I inherited something beautiful:
**a fully configured Terminus setup** with a long list of servers and databases, most of which were
made accessible via port forwarding and `.pem` files._

_It felt magical._

_One click and I was inside a remote EC2 instance. Another quick config and I was securely accessing
a production PostgreSQL database ‚Äî right from my laptop._

_When it was time to move on from the company, I found myself passing on that same setup to the next
person. All the right `.pem` files, SSH aliases, and database forwarding rules ‚Äî just like they were
once handed to me._

_That's when I realized: I had **used SSH daily**, but never truly appreciated **how it worked under
the hood**._

_So this post is both a thank-you note to SSH and a deep dive into how it does what it does ‚Äî
especially around **remote access** and **port forwarding**._

## üîê What SSH Is, Really

SSH (Secure Shell) is a **cryptographic network protocol** that lets you securely communicate with
remote machines over an insecure network like the internet.

Think of it as:

> "A secure tunnel that encrypts everything ‚Äî login, commands, files ‚Äî between your machine and the
> remote system."

Under the hood, SSH uses:

- **Asymmetric encryption** for authentication (your SSH key pair)
- **Symmetric encryption** for actual data transfer (after the handshake)
- **MAC (Message Authentication Codes)** to ensure message integrity

---

## üóùÔ∏è How SSH Authentication Works

Let's say you're using a `.pem` file or an SSH key to connect.

Here's what's happening step-by-step:

1. **Key Pair**: You have a private key (`id_rsa` or `.pem`) and the remote machine has the
   corresponding public key (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
2. **Challenge**: The server sends a challenge encrypted with your public key.
3. **Proof**: Your client decrypts it with the private key and proves identity.
4. **Secure Tunnel**: Once authenticated, a symmetric encryption session begins for all future
   communication.

This handshake ensures that **no passwords are sent over the wire** and **no one can impersonate
you** unless they have your private key.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Remote SSH ‚Äî Accessing Machines Over the Internet

When you run a command like this:

```bash
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-12-34-56-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

You're telling your machine to:

- Use the private key at `my-key.pem`
- Connect via port **22** (default SSH)
- Use `ec2-user` as the login
- Trust the public IP (or DNS) of the EC2 instance
- Negotiate a secure connection using SSH protocol

The server checks your public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. If it matches, you're in ‚Äî and you
can now treat that remote machine like it's your own terminal.

---

## üåâ What About Port Forwarding?

Port forwarding lets you **tunnel traffic from your local machine to a remote service**, like a
database or a dashboard, **through the SSH connection**.

### üß≠ Local Port Forwarding

This is the most common. It forwards traffic from a local port to a remote host/port.

```bash
ssh -i "my-key.pem" -L 5432:localhost:5432 ec2-user@remote-host
```

What this does:

- Binds `localhost:5432` on _your laptop_
- Forwards all traffic to `localhost:5432` _on the remote EC2 instance_
- You can now connect to the remote Postgres DB via `localhost:5432` on your local machine

> It feels like the database is running locally ‚Äî but it's actually remote.

### üß≠ Remote Port Forwarding

Less common, but powerful in reverse. It allows the **remote machine to access a service on your
local machine**.

```bash
ssh -R 9000:localhost:3000 ec2-user@remote-host
```

Now `localhost:9000` on the remote machine will forward to your local `localhost:3000`.

Useful when:

- You want to expose your local development server to a remote environment (e.g., testing a webhook
  endpoint on a cloud server).

### üß≠ Dynamic Port Forwarding

This creates a SOCKS proxy that can route traffic to multiple destinations through your SSH
connection:

```bash
ssh -D 8080 ec2-user@remote-host
```

What this does:

- Creates a SOCKS proxy server on your local machine at port 8080
- Any applications configured to use this proxy will route their traffic through the SSH tunnel
- Perfect for browsing internal websites or accessing multiple services without setting up
  individual forwards

---

## üß∞ How I Used It in Practice

At work, I had a dozen databases across different environments (dev, staging, prod), each set up
using:

```bash
ssh -i key.pem -L <local-port>:localhost:<remote-db-port> ec2-user@bastion-host
```

Sometimes I chained bastion hosts using `ProxyCommand`, like:

```bash
Host prod-db
  HostName internal-db
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key.pem
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion-host
```

All this was stored in my `.ssh/config`, and configured in Terminus so that it _just worked_.

And it was easy to hand over ‚Äî just zip up `.pem` files, share `.ssh/config`, and document the port
mappings.

---

## üß† Why This Matters More Than We Realize

SSH feels like an invisible convenience, but it's a gateway to:

- **Security**: Password-less, encrypted access
- **Productivity**: Quick terminal access, effortless port forwarding
- **Flexibility**: Tunnels, proxies, chained access across environments
- **Simplicity**: Everything from Git access to database admin goes through SSH

---

## üõë A Few Gotchas to Watch For

- Don't share `.pem` or private keys carelessly ‚Äî they're as powerful as passwords.
- Always use `chmod 400 key.pem` to restrict file permissions.
- Expired or rotated keys can silently break access (good to automate reminders).
- Monitor for zombie port-forwarding sessions that never get used.
- Be careful with the `-g` flag in port forwarding, which makes your forwarded ports accessible to
  other machines on your network.
- Remember that frequent disconnections might require using `ServerAliveInterval` and
  `ServerAliveCountMax` in your SSH config.

---

## üìã Advanced SSH Configuration

Your `.ssh/config` file can make all the difference in your SSH experience. Here are some powerful
configurations:

```bash
# Default settings for all hosts
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# Jump host configuration
Host bastion
    HostName bastion.example.com
    User jumpuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/jump_key.pem

# Internal hosts accessed through the jump host
Host internal-*
    ProxyJump bastion
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/internal_key.pem

# Database access with automatic port forwarding
Host db-prod
    HostName db-prod.internal
    LocalForward 5432:localhost:5432
    LocalForward 6379:redis-prod:6379
    User dbadmin
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/db_key.pem
    ProxyJump bastion
```

With this configuration, running `ssh db-prod` automatically:

- Connects to the bastion host first
- Jumps to the db-prod server
- Sets up port forwarding for both PostgreSQL and Redis
- All with a single command!

## üîç Troubleshooting Common SSH Issues

When things go wrong, these are the common culprits:

1. **Permission issues**: Always check file permissions with `ls -la ~/.ssh/` and ensure private
   keys are set to `600` or `400`.

2. **Host key verification failures**: If you see the dreaded "Host key verification failed", it
   might be due to:

   - Server IP changed but hostname remained the same
   - Server reinstalled with new keys
   - Man-in-the-middle attack (rare but possible)

   To fix: `ssh-keygen -R hostname` to remove the old key, then reconnect.

3. **Connection timeouts**: Check for:

   - Network connectivity issues
   - Firewall rules blocking port 22
   - SSH service not running on the target host

4. **Authentication failures**: Verify:

   - You're using the correct key
   - The server has your public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys`
   - The key format is compatible with the server

5. **Port forwarding failures**: Common causes include:
   - Target port already in use
   - Insufficient permissions on the remote server
   - Binding to port < 1024 without root privileges

The `-v` flag (or `-vv` or `-vvv` for more verbosity) is your best friend when troubleshooting:

```bash
ssh -vvv -i key.pem user@hostname
```

## üîö Final Thoughts

SSH might feel like a quiet background utility, but it's one of the most elegant and powerful tools
we use as engineers.

Whether it's opening 10+ Postgres instances from your laptop, or handing over the keys to
infrastructure with a single file ‚Äî it all just works. And that's beautiful.

If you've never looked deeper into how SSH works, take a moment this week to try `ssh -v`, explore
`.ssh/config`, or forward a port manually. You'll come away with a new appreciation for this unsung
hero of DevOps.

_Sometimes, understanding the tools you use every day is the best kind of magic._
