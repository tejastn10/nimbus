I've finished this thought-provoking novel about Nora Seed, who finds herself in a library between
life and death. Each book in the library represents a different version of her life had she made
different choices, allowing her to experience the many paths her life could have taken.

## Themes I Noticed

**Regret and Possibility**

- The burden of "what if" thinking
- How small decisions can lead to vastly different outcomes
- Finding peace with the choices we've made

**Depression and Mental Health**

- The distorted thinking that accompanies depression
- How we undervalue our impact on others
- Finding reasons to live amid despair

**Identity and Purpose**

- What constitutes a "successful" life
- How we define ourselves through our choices
- Finding meaning in ordinary existence

## Memorable Quotes

"The only way to learn is to live."

"Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?"

"Never underestimate the big importance of small things."

Haig's novel combines philosophical depth with emotional resonance, using its fantastical premise to
explore very real questions about purpose, happiness, and the nature of a fulfilled life. Though it
deals with heavy themes including suicide and depression, it ultimately delivers a life-affirming
message about appreciating the unique path we're on. The concept of the library itself—a space
between life and death where infinite possibilities exist—creates a memorable framework for
examining universal human questions about choice and regret.
