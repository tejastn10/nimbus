  how we can see the world more clearly."

I've completed this eye-opening book that challenges our instinctive biases about the state of the
world. Hans Rosling and his co-authors provide data-based evidence that contradicts many of our
pessimistic assumptions about global development, health, and poverty.

## Themes I Noticed

**Cognitive Biases**

- The gap instinct that divides the world into "us" and "them"
- The negativity instinct that makes us notice the bad more than the good
- The fear instinct that magnifies scary things

**Progress Reality**

- The documented improvements in global health
- The reduction in extreme poverty worldwide
- The rise in education levels globally

**Data Literacy**

- How statistics can be misrepresented
- Tools for critical thinking about numbers
- The importance of context when interpreting data

## Memorable Quotes

"The world cannot be understood without numbers. But the world cannot be understood with numbers
alone."

"Being aware of our dramatic instincts can help us avoid being misled by sensationalist stories."

"We tend to divide things into opposing binary categories with nothing in between—but reality is
rarely binary."

This book has genuinely changed my perspective on global development and taught me to approach news
and statistics with a more factful mindset. The late Hans Rosling's passion for data and human
progress shines through on every page.
