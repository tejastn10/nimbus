I've finished this practical guide to reclaiming our attention and energy in a world of endless
distractions. Written by two former Google Ventures designers, the book offers a framework for
prioritizing what truly matters to you rather than defaulting to busy work or mindless browsing.

## Themes I Noticed

**Intentional Focus**

- Selecting a single "Highlight" for each day
- Designing your environment to support focused work
- The power of proactive rather than reactive time use

**Digital Minimalism**

- Practical strategies for reducing smartphone addiction
- Creating "speed bumps" before distracting activities
- Customizing technology to serve your priorities

**Energy Management**

- The connection between physical well-being and mental focus
- How food, movement, and sleep impact productivity
- Creating sustainable daily rhythms

## Memorable Quotes

"Busy is a problem. Busy is a state we enter when we're not in control of our time, attention, and
priorities."

"Default behaviors are not neutral. They're products, designed to capture your time and attention."

"Perfection is a distractionâ€”another shiny object taking your attention away from your real
priorities."

What makes this book stand out is its flexible, experimental approach. Rather than offering a rigid
system, Knapp and Zeratsky present their framework as a menu of tactics to try, emphasizing the
importance of finding what works for your specific situation. I appreciated the straightforward,
conversational tone and the emphasis on sustainable changes rather than productivity at all costs.
Their background in design thinking is evident in how they approach daily habits as systems to be
prototyped and refined.
