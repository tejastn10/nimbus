## Memorable Quotes

"Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire."

"History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and
the winner writes the history books."

"Faith is a continuum, and we each fall on that line where we may. By attempting to rigidly classify
ethereal concepts like faith, we end up debating semantics to the point where we entirely miss the
obvious."

What makes this novel so compelling is Brown's ability to weave together multiple disciplines—art
history, cryptography, religious studies, and architecture—into a coherent mystery. The novel's
breakneck pacing, with chapters often ending on cliffhangers, propels readers through a single night
of revelations across Paris and beyond.

The book sparked enormous controversy with its fictional premise about Jesus and Mary Magdalene,
demonstrating fiction's power to engage people with historical and religious questions. While
historians and theologians disputed many of Brown's claims, the novel succeeded in making readers
think critically about how religious traditions are formed and maintained. Beyond the controversy,
it's ultimately an entertaining exploration of how symbols, secrets, and sacred spaces encode
meanings that transcend their surface appearances.
