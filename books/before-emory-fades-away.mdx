  and human connection."

I've finished the third installment in Kawaguchi's time-traveling café series. This book introduces
a new location—a café in Hakodate that shares the same magical time-traveling properties as the
Tokyo café—while maintaining the emotional resonance and philosophical depth of the previous books.

## Themes I Noticed

**Memory and Identity**

- How memories shape who we are
- The fear of forgetting and being forgotten
- Preserving connections across time

**Choices and Consequences**

- The ripple effects of seemingly small decisions
- Finding peace with the paths not taken
- Understanding the motivations behind others' choices

**Hope and Healing**

- Finding strength to move forward
- Reconciliation across time and space
- The comfort found in understanding

## Memorable Quotes

"Some memories fade, but they never disappear completely."

"People don't realize the value of things until they lose them."

"Sometimes the weight of words left unsaid is heavier than any spoken truth."

This third entry expands the universe of the series while remaining intimate and character-focused.
By introducing a new café location with its own rules and atmospheric qualities, Kawaguchi refreshes
the concept while continuing to explore the central question of what we would do if given the chance
to revisit our past. The stories remain poignant explorations of human connection, regret, and
healing.
