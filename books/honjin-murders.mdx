I've completed this masterful locked-room mystery, the first in Yokomizo's acclaimed series
featuring detective Kosuke Kindaichi. Set in rural Japan in the 1930s, the novel centers around a
gruesome murder that takes place on the night of a wedding at the Ichiyanagi family's honjin (a
traditional inn for nobility).

## Themes I Noticed

**Family Legacy and Tradition**

- The burdens of maintaining a prestigious family name
- How tradition can become a prison
- The clash between modernity and traditional Japanese values

**Social Class and Appearance**

- The importance of "face" in Japanese society
- How status affects justice and investigation
- The hidden dynamics beneath polite facades

**The Locked Room Puzzle**

- The seemingly impossible nature of the crime
- The significance of physical clues and timing
- How misdirection plays into the solution

## Memorable Quotes

"The koto's sound hung in the air like a premonition of disaster."

"Murder is always a confession of weakness."

"In a locked room mystery, what matters is not only how the criminal got out, but why they needed
the room to be locked in the first place."

Yokomizo's novel stands as a brilliant example of the golden age detective story with a distinctly
Japanese sensibility. The atmospheric setting in a snowbound rural village adds to the
claustrophobic tension. What makes this mystery particularly satisfying is how it combines the
cerebral puzzle-solving aspects of Western detective fiction with deep insights into Japanese
culture and psychology. The eccentric detective Kindaichi, with his stutter and disheveled
appearance belying his brilliant mind, makes for a memorable protagonist in this classic that
deserves its place alongside the works of Christie and Carr.
