I've finished this inspiring follow-up to "Steal Like an Artist," which shifts focus from the
creative process to sharing that work with the world. Kleon challenges the notion that artists
should work in isolation, instead advocating for generosity, transparency, and building community.

## Themes I Noticed

**Process Over Product**

- The value in sharing your creative journey, not just the finished work
- How documenting your process helps both yourself and others
- Turning the messy behind-the-scenes into valuable content

**Building Community**

- Finding your audience by being open about your influences
- The importance of generosity in creative work
- Creating connections through sharing what you love

**Sustainable Creative Practice**

- Building a sharing habit that maintains momentum
- Balancing vulnerability with boundaries
- Finding the courage to put unfinished or imperfect work into the world

## Memorable Quotes

"In this connected but cautious world, being open and generous is a way to become part of the flow."

"Don't think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine."

"Forget about being an expert or a professional, and wear your amateurism on your sleeve."

Kleon practices what he preachesâ€”the book itself feels like a generous sharing of ideas,
incorporating visual elements, quotes from others, and personal anecdotes. His approach is
refreshingly anti-perfectionist, emphasizing that consistent sharing of authentic work is more
valuable than occasional bursts of polished content. For anyone who makes things but struggles with
the idea of putting themselves out there, this book provides both practical strategies and
much-needed encouragement.
