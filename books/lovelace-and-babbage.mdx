  "A delightfully inventive graphic novel that reimagines Victorian mathematicians Ada
  Lovelace and Charles Babbage in an alternate universe where they actually built the Analytical
  Engine and use it to fight crime and have adventures."

I've completed this wonderfully creative and surprisingly educational graphic novel. Padua combines
meticulous historical research with wild imagination, creating an alternate history where two
pioneering computer scientists get to fulfill their computational dreams—and then some.

## Themes I Noticed

**The Intersection of Art and Science**

- Mathematics as creative expression
- How technical innovation requires imagination
- The beauty inherent in logical systems

**Historical What-Ifs**

- Exploring roads not taken in technological development
- How different choices might have altered history
- The tension between historical accuracy and creative freedom

**Recognition and Legacy**

- Celebrating overlooked pioneers, especially women in STEM
- How history remembers (or forgets) contributions
- The importance of giving credit where it's due

## What Makes It Special

Padua's artwork brilliantly captures Victorian aesthetics while the extensive footnotes provide
genuine historical context—making this both entertaining and educational. The book celebrates
Lovelace and Babbage's actual achievements while playfully imagining what might have been if
Babbage's Difference Engine had been completed. The humor ranges from slapstick adventure to clever
mathematical jokes, making complex concepts accessible without dumbing them down.

The graphic novel format allows Padua to visualize abstract mathematical concepts in creative ways,
while the alternate-reality framing device gives these historical figures the recognition and
adventure they deserve. It's both a love letter to the history of computing and a testament to the
power of imagination in understanding the past.
