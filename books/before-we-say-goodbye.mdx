I've completed the fourth book in Kawaguchi's heartwarming series about cafés where customers can
briefly travel through time. This installment returns to the original Tokyo café for more stories of
people seeking closure, understanding, and reconciliation through the mysterious time-traveling
chair.

## Themes I Noticed

**Farewell and Closure**

- The importance of proper goodbyes
- Finding peace with loss
- Words that need to be said before it's too late

**Connection Across Time**

- Bonds that transcend temporal boundaries
- The lasting impact of brief encounters
- How understanding the past helps shape the future

**Courage and Vulnerability**

- Finding strength to face difficult truths
- The bravery required to be honest
- Confronting fears to achieve peace

## Memorable Quotes

"Sometimes the heaviest things we carry are the words we never spoke."

"Time doesn't heal all wounds, but understanding can make them easier to bear."

"We say goodbye so many times in our lives, but some farewells shape us more than others."

Like its predecessors, "Before We Say Goodbye" uses its fantasy premise to explore deeply human
emotions and relationships. Kawaguchi continues to excel at creating characters whose struggles feel
authentic despite the magical setting. The time travel remains a narrative tool rather than the
focus, allowing the emotional journeys to take center stage. This fourth book maintains the gentle
wisdom and compassionate perspective that have made the series so beloved.
