  "A heartwarming, quirky Japanese novel about a café that offers customers the chance to travel
  back in time."
---

I've finished this moving tale centered around a small basement café in Tokyo where customers can
travel back in time—but only if they follow specific rules, including returning before their coffee
gets cold. Through four interconnected stories, Kawaguchi explores regret, love, and the human
desire to change the past.

## Themes I Noticed

**Time and Perspective**

- The value of moments we take for granted
- How understanding changes even when outcomes cannot
- The healing power of closure

**Rules and Limitations**

- The impossible rules of time travel as metaphor
- Accepting what we cannot change
- Finding meaning within constraints

**Connection and Relationships**

- Family bonds across generations
- Unspoken feelings and missed opportunities
- The lingering power of love

## Memorable Quotes

"Regardless of whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't
change."

"No matter what difficulties people face, they will always have the strength to overcome them. It
just takes time to find that strength."

"In the end, people have to make the best of whatever situation they're in. Even if they can't
change the situation itself, they can change how they think about it."

This gentle, philosophical novel uses its fantastical premise to examine very human emotions. The
simplicity of the setting—just a small café—contrasts beautifully with the emotional complexity of
each character's journey. Despite the magical element, the story feels deeply authentic in its
portrayal of grief, regret, and reconciliation.
