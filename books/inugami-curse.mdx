I've finished this intricate mystery, often considered Yokomizo's masterpiece, which follows
detective Kosuke Kindaichi as he investigates a series of grotesque murders within the wealthy
Inugami clan. As family members are killed off one by one following the reading of a complex will,
Kindaichi must untangle decades of secrets, resentments, and wartime trauma.

## Memorable Quotes

"Human memory is like a pond. The surface reflects clearly, but stir up the mud at the bottom and
everything becomes cloudy."

"Even the most carefully constructed masks slip eventually."

"In a family as wealthy as the Inugamis, money doesn't solve problemsâ€”it creates them."

This novel showcases Yokomizo's skill at crafting complex, multi-layered mysteries that also serve
as social commentary. The Inugami family's internal dynamics reflect broader themes in post-war
Japanese society, including changing gender roles and the erosion of traditional family structures.
The increasingly bizarre and theatrical murders create an atmosphere of mounting dread, while
Kindaichi's methodical investigation provides a reassuring counterbalance. The solutions to the
mysteries are satisfyingly intricate without feeling contrived, and the psychological motivations
feel authentic despite the sometimes melodramatic elements.
