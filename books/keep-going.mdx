I've completed the third book in Kleon's creativity trilogy, which focuses on sustaining creative
practice through difficulty, distraction, and burnout. Particularly relevant in our overwhelming
digital age, "Keep Going" offers practical wisdom for establishing enduring creative habits.

## Themes I Noticed

**Sustainable Creative Practice**

- Creating systems rather than relying on motivation
- The importance of daily habits and routines
- Finding joy in the process rather than fixating on outcomes

**Digital Mindfulness**

- Strategies for managing information overload
- Creating physical spaces for focused work
- The value of disconnecting from online noise

**Resilience and Perspective**

- Viewing creative blocks as normal parts of the process
- Finding meaning in small daily actions
- Balancing ambition with contentment

## Memorable Quotes

"Every day is a blank page: When you're in a slump, you can begin again."

"Creativity is not just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out."

"Worry less about getting things done. Worry more about things worth doing."

This book feels like a calming hand on the shoulder during creative crisis. Kleon acknowledges the
real challenges of maintaining creative momentum in difficult times without minimizing them. His
practical suggestions—from establishing daily routines to creating "bliss stations" for focused
work—are complemented by philosophical reflections on what makes creative work meaningful. While his
previous books focus on starting and sharing creative work, "Keep Going" completes the trilogy by
addressing the crucial question of sustainability.
