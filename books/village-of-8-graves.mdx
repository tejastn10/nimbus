I've finished reading this atmospheric and haunting entry in the Kosuke Kindaichi series. The novel
weaves an eerie tale around a cursed village, past massacres, and a series of present-day murders
that bring old legends to life. Yokomizo masterfully blends folklore and modern detective work,
creating a story that feels both timeless and tightly plotted.

## Themes I Noticed

**Legacy and Curse**

- How village myths and superstitions influence real-world behavior
- The weight of ancestral guilt and collective trauma
- History repeating itself in subtle and brutal ways

**Identity and Betrayal**

- Hidden identities and secrets that span generations
- Trust eroded by past violence and inherited suspicion
- Characters grappling with the shadows of their lineage

**Isolation and Suspicion**

- The psychological toll of living in a place steeped in fear
- The impact of a closed, rural society on justice and truth-seeking
- Outsiders versus insiders — and what it means to truly belong

## Memorable Quotes

"Even in places haunted by tragedy, people carry on—because they must."

"The past is never buried in the village of eight graves. It waits, silent and watching."

"Superstition thrives where truth hides in shadows."

Yokomizo delivers yet another layered and suspenseful mystery, with an unforgettable setting and a
deep sense of unease. The novel’s exploration of collective memory, guilt, and justice stands out
even among the greats of the genre. The tension between folklore and fact adds a unique flavor that
lingers well beyond the final pages.
