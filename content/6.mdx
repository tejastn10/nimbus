_While implementing the feature for creating project versions at my organization, I leveraged
Redux-Saga's channel feature to schedule a recurring version creation action every 15 minutes. The
way Redux-Saga manages channels and encapsulates complex logic for developers fascinated me. Despite
its powerful capabilities, Redux-Saga is surprisingly underrated in the React community._

_This article explores key Redux-Saga concepts and why they can be invaluable for React developers
using middleware._

## Introduction

Redux-Saga is a powerful middleware for handling side effects in Redux applications. While many
developers are familiar with basic effects like `takeLatest` and `call`, the library offers advanced
utilities that make it an underrated powerhouse for managing complex async flows.

In this article, we'll cover:

- Essential Redux-Saga effects: `put`, `call`, `fork`, `all`, `take`, `takeLatest`, `takeEvery`,
  `delay`
- Managing concurrent tasks with `race`
- Leveraging `actionChannel` for queued processing
- Using Redux-Saga channels for more controlled event handling
- Practical examples and best practices

## Understanding Key Redux-Saga Effects

### `put`

Dispatches an action to the Redux store.

```typescript
import { put } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data });
```

### `call`

Calls a function (usually an API request) and waits for its response.

```typescript
import { call } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield call(api.fetchUser, userId);
```

### `fork`

Spawns a non-blocking task.

```typescript
import { fork } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield fork(watchUserLogin);
```

### `all`

Runs multiple sagas in parallel.

```typescript
import { all, call } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield all([call(fetchUsers), call(fetchPosts)]);
```

### `take`

Waits for a specific action before proceeding.

```typescript
import { take } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield take("LOGIN_REQUEST");
```

### `takeLatest`

Only the latest invocation of the saga will be executed, canceling previous ones.

```typescript
import { takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield takeLatest("FETCH_USER", fetchUserSaga);
```

### `takeEvery`

Runs a saga for every action occurrence without canceling previous executions.

```typescript
import { takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield takeEvery("ADD_ITEM", addItemSaga);
```

### `delay`

Delays execution for a specified time.

```typescript
import { delay } from "redux-saga/effects";

yield delay(2000); // 2 seconds delay
```

## Sign-Up Example: Combining Multiple Redux-Saga Effects

```typescript
import { Action } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { CallEffect, PutEffect, call, put, takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { AxiosError, AxiosResponse } from "axios";
import { signUpRequest, signUpSuccess, signUpError } from "../actions";
import { SignUpRequest, SignUpSuccess, SignUpError } from "../../types/store";
import { signUpUser } from "../../api/signUp";
import { handleErrors } from "../../utils/error.handler";

function* signUp(
	action: Action & { payload: SignUpRequest; type: string }
): Generator<
	| CallEffect<AxiosResponse<void> | AxiosError<unknown>>
	| PutEffect<{ payload: SignUpSuccess | SignUpError; type: string }>
	| unknown,
	void,
	AxiosResponse<void>
> {
	try {
		if (signUpRequest.match(action)) {
			const response: AxiosResponse<void> = yield call(signUpUser, action.payload);
			if (response.status !== 201) {
				throw new Error("SignUp failed!");
			}
			yield put(
				signUpSuccess({ error: null, success: true, feedbackMessage: "User Sign Up Successful" })
			);
		}
	} catch (error) {
		yield* handleErrors(error, signUpError);
	}
}

function* watchSignUpRequest(): Generator {
	yield takeLatest(signUpRequest.type, signUp);
}

export { watchSignUpRequest };
```

## **Leveraging Redux-Saga Channels for Auto Version Creation**

### **Initial Implementation Using `take` and `delay`**

The initial implementation used a simple `while (true)` loop with `delay`. Every `AUTOSAVE_TIMEOUT`
milliseconds, a new autosave request was dispatched.

```typescript
const autoCreateCanvasVersion = function* (params: CreateVersionRequest) {
	while (true) {
		yield put(createCanvasVersionRequest(params));
		yield delay(AUTOSAVE_TIMEOUT);
	}
};
```

While this approach works, it has several drawbacks:

- **Lack of Event Control**: The loop runs indefinitely, making it difficult to stop the autosave
  process dynamically.
- **Inefficient Resource Usage**: It keeps running even if the autosave feature is disabled, leading
  to unnecessary function executions.

To address these issues, we introduce `eventChannel` in the improved implementation.

### **Improved Implementation Using Channels**

In the improved version, we use `eventChannel` to emit events at an interval, allowing **external
control** over when autosave occurs. Instead of manually handling delays, Redux-Saga now reacts to
incoming events efficiently.

```typescript
import { eventChannel, buffers } from "redux-saga";
import { take, put, call, fork, select, takeEvery, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";

// Creates an event channel that emits an autosave trigger at a fixed interval
const createAutoSaveChannel = () =>
	eventChannel((emit) => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			emit(true);
		}, AUTOSAVE_TIMEOUT);

		return () => clearInterval(interval);
	}, buffers.sliding(1));

function* autoCreateCanvasVersion(params: CreateVersionRequest) {
	// Check version history flag once at the start
	const versionHistoryEnabled = yield select(selectVersionHistoryEnabled);
	if (!versionHistoryEnabled) return;

	const channel = yield call(createAutoSaveChannel);

	try {
		while (true) {
			yield take(channel);
			yield put(createCanvasVersionRequest(params));
		}
	} finally {
		channel.close();
	}
}

function* watchAutoCreateCanvasVersion() {
	yield takeEvery(startAutoCreate.type, function* (action) {
		const params: CreateVersionRequest = action.payload;
		const task = yield fork(autoCreateCanvasVersion, params);

		yield take(stopAutoCreate.type);
		yield cancel(task);
	});
}
```

### **Improvements Using Channels**

1. **Event-Driven Autosaving:**  
   Instead of an infinite loop using `delay`, we now use an `eventChannel` that **emits at fixed
   intervals**. This prevents blocking issues and ensures that autosave events are **managed
   externally**.

2. **Sliding Buffer Optimization:**  
   We use a **sliding(1) buffer** so that if multiple autosave events are triggered while a previous
   one is still running, **only the latest one is kept**, avoiding unnecessary queuing of outdated
   save requests.

3. **Efficient Stopping Mechanism:**
   - We check `versionHistoryEnabled` **only once at saga startup** and avoid unnecessary Redux
     state checks.
   - Instead of relying on Redux state updates, we **stop autosaving when `stopAutoCreate` is
     dispatched** by **cancelling the task**.
   - The `finally` block ensures that the event channel is closed when the saga exits, preventing
     memory leaks.

## Conclusion

Redux-Saga offers an incredibly powerful way to manage side effects in Redux applications. With
features like `actionChannel` and `eventChannel`, developers can gain fine-grained control over
asynchronous processes.
