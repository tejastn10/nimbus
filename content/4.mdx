_CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins
(domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
Without CORS, modern browsers would block cross-origin requests for security reasons, preventing
malicious behavior._

### Why is CORS Necessary?

When building modern web applications, the frontend and backend often run on different domains or
ports, especially during development. For example:

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:5000`

By default, browsers block requests from the frontend to the backend due to the **Same-Origin
Policy**. This is where CORS comes inâ€”it acts as a controlled way to bypass the same-origin
restriction, enabling secure communication.

A typical CORS scenario involves the frontend making an API call to the backend, and the backend
explicitly allowing such requests by including certain headers in its response.

### Configuring CORS in NestJS with Fastify

While enabling CORS in a NestJS application using Express is straightforward, using Fastify requires
a slightly different approach. When I was working on a project, I decided to switch from Viteâ€™s
proxy server to enabling CORS on my Fastify server, both as a learning opportunity and for better
alignment with production setups. However, I found the documentation and available articles on
enabling CORS for Fastify in NestJS to be sparse.

Hereâ€™s how I tackled it.

### Step 1: Define CORS Options

To keep things clean and reusable, I created a dedicated `cors.options.ts` file for my CORS
configuration. Here's what it looks like:

```typescript
import { type CorsOptions } from "@nestjs/common/interfaces/external/cors-options.interface";

const CorsOptions: CorsOptions = {
	origin: [
		// ? Development environment
		"http://localhost:3000",
		// * Add Production and Staging URLs here
	],
	methods: "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
	allowedHeaders: "Content-Type, Authorization",
	credentials: true,
	maxAge: 86400,
};

export { CorsOptions };
```

### Step 2: Use CORS Options in the Main Application

In the `main.ts` file, I configured the Fastify server to use these options:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { FastifyAdapter, NestFastifyApplication } from "@nestjs/platform-fastify";
import helmet from "@fastify/helmet";

import { CorsOptions } from "./options/cors.options";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

const bootstrap = async (): Promise<void> => {
	const FastifyModule = new FastifyAdapter();

	// Enabling things for Fastify server
	FastifyModule.register(helmet); // Secure headers
	FastifyModule.enableCors(CorsOptions); // Enable CORS with custom options

	const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(AppModule, FastifyModule);

	// Start the application
	const PORT = 5000;
	await app.listen(PORT, () => {
		console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
	});
};

bootstrap();
```

#### Key Points to Note

- **Origins**: I specified the allowed origins explicitly, such as `http://localhost:3000` for
  development. Add production or staging URLs as needed.
- **Methods**: Only specific HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` are allowed.
- **Credentials**: By setting `credentials: true`, the server allows cookies or authentication
  tokens to be sent with requests.
- **Modular Approach**: Placing the CORS options in a separate file helps maintain modularity and
  makes it easier to modify configurations in the future.

### Axios Configuration for the Frontend

Here is my `axiosConfig.ts` file, showing how I have configured Axios for the frontend:

```typescript
import axios, { AxiosRequestConfig } from "axios";

import { ContentType, ResponseType, ResponseEncoding } from "../config/requestConfig";

const baseURL = (import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL as string) ?? "http://localhost:5000";

const axiosRequestConfig: AxiosRequestConfig = {
	baseURL,
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": ContentType.JSON,
	},
	timeout: 330000,
	withCredentials: true,
	responseType: ResponseType.JSON,
	responseEncoding: ResponseEncoding.UTF8,
	maxContentLength: 50000,
	validateStatus(status) {
		return status >= 200 && status < 300;
	},
	maxRedirects: 5,
};

const AxiosInstance = axios.create(axiosRequestConfig);

export { axiosRequestConfig, AxiosInstance };
```

### Learnings and Final Thoughts

While configuring CORS for Fastify in NestJS, I initially used Express-specific solutions, which
felt incorrect and hacky. After thorough research, I found the proper way to enable it using the
enableCors method of the Fastify adapter.

If youâ€™re using my [**Verdant**](https://github.com/tejastn10/verdant) turborepo template, you can
find an example of this CORS configuration there. The repo also demonstrates how to structure a
modern monorepo using tools like **TurboRepo** and **Vite**.

If you want to learn more about CORS, check out this
[MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), which does a fantastic job of
explaining the concept in detail.

CORS can seem tricky initially, but with the right approach, itâ€™s straightforward to configure and
ensures secure communication between your frontend and backend.
