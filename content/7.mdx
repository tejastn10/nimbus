_In containerized environments like Docker, log management can become a significant issue,
especially when logs grow uncontrollably. Docker containers often generate logs for various events,
such as errors, warnings, status messages, and application-specific logs. If not properly managed,
these logs can fill up disk space quickly, leading to performance issues or even server crashes._

_This article discusses how to prevent such log overflows on a Docker server, focusing on
controlling the log storage size using the `systemd` journal configuration._

### Docker Logging and Its Impact on Disk Space

By default, Docker logs container activity using the `json-file` logging driver. This driver stores
logs in JSON format in a container's log file, typically located in the
`/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/` directory.

While these logs provide valuable insights into the container's operation, they can accumulate over
time, especially in high-traffic applications or those generating verbose logs. Some factors
contributing to excessive log growth include:

1. **Verbose Application Logs**: Applications running inside Docker containers may log a lot of
   information, especially in development or debug modes.
2. **Docker Daemon Logs**: The Docker daemon itself logs events such as container starts, stops, and
   restarts.
3. **Log Rotation Configuration**: If log rotation is not configured, logs can grow indefinitely,
   filling up the disk space.

This unchecked growth can lead to a situation where logs fill up the disk, slowing down the system
or even causing crashes.

### Preventing Log Floods Using `systemd` Configuration

On many Linux systems, `systemd` is responsible for managing system services, including logging
through `journald`. `journald` is a system service that collects and stores logs. By default,
`journald` can store logs in a ring buffer (in-memory) or persist them to disk.

If your Docker logs are flooding the disk, one way to control this is by configuring `systemd`'s
journaling settings. Specifically, the `SystemMaxUse` option in the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`
file can limit the maximum disk space allocated for logs, preventing them from growing beyond a set
size.

#### Steps to Limit `journald` Logs:

1. **Check Disk Usage:** Use the `df -h` command to check the current disk usage, especially
   focusing on directories like `/var` where logs might be stored.

2. **Modify `journald` Configuration:** Edit the `journald.conf` file, which controls the logging
   behavior of `systemd`. This file is usually located at `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`. You can
   adjust the following parameters:

   - **`SystemMaxUse`**: This sets the maximum disk space that `systemd` logs can occupy. If the
     logs exceed this size, older logs are deleted automatically.
   - **`SystemKeepFree`**: You can specify the amount of disk space to keep free on the system.
   - **`SystemMaxFileSize`**: This controls the maximum size of individual log files.
   - **`SystemMaxFiles`**: This controls how many rotated log files to keep.

   For example, to limit the logs to 50MB, set:

   ```plaintext
   [Journal]
   SystemMaxUse=50M
   ```

3. **Restart `systemd-journald` Service:** After modifying the configuration, restart the
   `systemd-journald` service to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
   ```

4. **Verify Log Changes:** You can verify the changes using the `journalctl` command or by checking
   the disk usage again with `df -h` to see if the logs are now limited.

### Docker Compose Logging Configuration

In addition to configuring systemd logging, Docker Compose provides a way to manage logging for each
container in your application. By configuring the logging driver in the docker-compose.yml file, you
can set limits on the log file size and the number of rotated log files.

Here's an example of how to configure logging in a Docker Compose file:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: your-app-image
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "50m" # Maximum log file size before rotation
        max-file: "3" # Number of log files to keep
```

**Explanation:**

- `driver: "json-file"`: This specifies that Docker should use the default json-file logging driver.
  You can also use other drivers like syslog or fluentd if you prefer.
- `max-size`: Defines the maximum size of each log file. In this case, when the log file reaches
  50MB, it will rotate.
- `max-file`: Limits the number of rotated log files to retain. For example, with max-file: 3,
  Docker will keep 3 log files, and older ones will be deleted as new logs are created.

This configuration ensures that your application container does not use an excessive amount of disk
space for logs, and the logs will be rotated automatically when they exceed the specified size.

Make sure to restart your Docker Compose stack to apply these changes:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

Same can be done when running the containers without the compose file. Docker allows you to
configure log rotation for containers directly through the `--log-opt` flag when running containers.
For example, setting `max-size` to limit the size of each log file and `max-file` to limit the
number of log files can help prevent log overflow.

Example command to limit Docker container logs:

```bash
docker run --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=3 <image>
```

### Why Logs Can Flood the Server

Docker logs can flood a server when:

1. **Excessive Logging by Containers**: If a container generates large amounts of logs (e.g., error
   logs, debugging logs), they can grow rapidly.
2. **Container Restart Loops**: Containers that frequently restart due to errors can generate
   multiple logs per second, quickly consuming available disk space.
3. **Lack of Log Rotation**: Without configuring log rotation or size limits, Docker logs can
   accumulate indefinitely, which is particularly problematic for long-running containers.

By configuring `systemd` to limit the logs, we ensure that logs do not consume excessive disk space,
preventing potential system slowdowns or crashes.

---

### Additional Recommendations

- **Centralized Logging Solutions**: Consider using centralized logging solutions like **ELK Stack
  (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**, **Fluentd**, or **Graylog**. These tools allow you to
  aggregate logs from multiple containers, set up retention policies, and avoid filling up local
  storage.

- **Monitoring Disk Usage**: Regularly monitor disk usage and logs to catch any potential issues
  before they flood the server. Tools like `docker system df` can provide insights into Docker's
  disk consumption.

---

### Conclusion

Managing logs in Docker is critical to ensure system health and avoid running into disk space
issues. By configuring `systemd`'s `journald` logging system and implementing Docker's own log
rotation mechanisms, you can effectively limit log growth. This ensures that your Docker containers
provide the necessary insights without flooding your server's disk space.
