_Docker is a set of the platform as service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver
software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their
own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through
well-defined channels._

_In version control systems, a monorepo is a software development strategy where code for many
projects is stored in the same repository._

### Why set up a Development Environment?

While developing a Full-Stack app we come across many things which we have to configure and are
necessary for building that application. Moreover, we might be working in a team or it may be an
Open-Source Project which has many contributors. As we consider these things we can definitely see,
the old excuse "It was working fine on my machine...". One can also implement the development setup
on their portfolio projects to showcase that they can implement their knowledge about Docker and
also familiarizing themselves with it.

Most of us know that we want a fast development and build process to tackle this. We set up a
development environment for our project using Docker to develop seamlessly without any OS-level
errors.

The practice here is one way you can implement Docker. There might be many ways that might suit your
scenario, so try to research more and try implementing them with the trial and error method, and
remember implementing them would definitely help in the long term.

### Step 1: Know your Project

For the demo, we are using my own Project which consists of React frontend and Nodejs Backend.

### Step 2: Add dev Dockerfiles to the project

üí° NOTE: If you're using Vs-Code it provides so much help in creating and managing Dockerfiles for
your environment. I'll provide a link showcasing how you can utilize Vs-Code to its full abilities
and add docker configuration for your platform. Vs-Code adds all that is required such as
dockerignore files and even debug configuration if specified.

**Frontend Dockerfile** The frontend Dockerfile is located in the _frontend/web_ folder.

```docker
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR "/app"

RUN yarn global add typescript
RUN yarn global add less

COPY ./package.json ./
COPY ./yarn.lock ./

RUN yarn install

COPY . .

RUN lessc --js ./src/styles/theme.less ./src/styles/theme.css

CMD [ "yarn", "start" ]
```

**Backend Dockerfile** The backend Dockerfile is located in _backend_ folder.

```docker
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR "/app"

RUN yarn global add typescript

COPY ./package.json ./
COPY ./yarn.lock ./

RUN yarn install

COPY . .

CMD [ "yarn", "server" ]
```

**Nginx Dockerfile**

The nginx Dockerfile is located in _nginx_ folder.

```docker
FROM nginx

COPY ./default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

These files are named _Dockerfile.dev_ for specifying that these are for development purposes only.

### Step 3: Add dev Docker-compose file to the project

The root folder contains the compose file adding all the services specified in the respective Docker
files. In my project, the development docker-compose file is _docker-compose.debug.yml_

```YAML
version: "3.4"

services:
  nginx:
    restart: always
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./nginx
    ports:
      - 3000:80
  backend:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./backend
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./backend:/app
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=5000
      - JWT_SECRET=clocked
      - MONGO_URI
  frontend:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./frontend/web
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - /app/src/styles
      - ./frontend/web:/app
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - REACT_APP_DEVELOPMENT_API_ENDPOINT=/devURL
```

### Step 4: Starting the project with docker-compose up

Now all that remains is to build and run the compose file and voila your setup is complete.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.debug.yml up --build
```

This article assumes prior knowledge about Docker, not much but familiarity with the tech is
sufficient. Do tell me how you would implement yours and also provide me where I can improve my
configuration.
