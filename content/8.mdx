_As someone who has been writing GitHub Actions for a long time, I've come to appreciate the value
of the [Act tool](https://github.com/nektos/act). It's been a game-changer for me, allowing me to:_

1. _Run actions locally and avoid the dreaded failed workflows showing up in the GitHub Actions tab
   üòÖ._
2. _Catch errors early, especially for workflows involving tasks like pushing code, Docker images,
   or deploying branches._
3. _Save time and resources by testing actions locally before pushing to GitHub._

### Getting Started with Act

The main dependency for Act is Docker, so make sure you have it installed on your system. Once
Docker is ready, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Install Act

Install Act using one of the following methods:

- **Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

  ```bash
  brew install act
  ```

- **Using Scoop (Windows):**

  ```bash
  scoop install act
  ```

- **Using Shell Script:**

  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
  ```

For other installation methods, check the
[official Act documentation](https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html).

#### Step 2: Configure Act

Once installed, run the following command to set up Act:

```bash
act
```

You'll be prompted to choose a default image for running your workflows:

- **Large size image:** ~17GB download and ~75GB disk space required. Mirrors GitHub-hosted runners.
- **Medium size image:** ~500MB. Includes essential tools for most workflows.
- **Micro size image:** <200MB. Contains only Node.js. Not compatible with all workflows.

Choose the image that best fits your requirements. For most use cases, the medium image is a good
balance between size and functionality.

#### Step 3: Start Using Act

Here are some common use cases for Act:

1. To see all available workflows in your repository, use:

   ```bash
   act -l
   ```

   **Example**: The following output showcases the use of the act -l command, which lists all
   available workflows in your repository. This provides a clear view of the workflows, jobs, and
   the events that trigger them

   ```bash
    act -l
    INFO[0000] Using docker host 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock', and daemon socket 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock'
    Stage  Job ID          Job name               Workflow name                   Workflow file       Events
    0      build-and-push  Build and Push Images  Build and Publish Docker Image  docker-image.yml    push
    0      lint            Linting Go Code        Lint                            lint.yml            pull_request
    0      security_audit  security_audit         Security Audit                  security-audit.yml  pull_request
    0      unit_tests      unit_tests             Unit Tests                      unit-test.yml       workflow_dispatch,pull_request
   ```

2. Run a specific workflow by specifying the event that triggers it. For example:

   ```bash
   act push
   ```

3. You can run a specific job within a workflow using:

   ```bash
   act -j <job_name>
   ```

   **Example**: Below is a trimmed output for the unit_tests job. Note that a lot of logs have been
   omitted for brevity, as the job produces extensive output

   ```bash
    act -j unit_tests

   ```

4. To use a specific workflow file, run:

   ```bash
   act -W .github/workflows/<workflow_file>.yml
   ```

5. Act supports loading environment variables from a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file with your
   variables and run:

   ```bash
   act --env-file .env
   ```

   Same is true for secrets file too. Create a `.secrets` file with your secrets and run:

   ```bash
   act --secret-file=.secrets
   ```

### Key Features and Limitations

#### Features

- **Test Locally:** Run workflows without pushing changes to GitHub.
- **Environment Variable Support:** Load `.env` files directly for configuration.
- **Workflow Debugging:** Quickly debug issues in your workflows.
- **Granular Control:** Run specific workflows, jobs, or tasks.

#### Limitations

- Some features of GitHub Actions are not fully supported (e.g., `workflow_dispatch` inputs).
- Requires Docker, so make sure your system meets the requirements.

This tool has been a lifesaver for me when developing workflows. If you're tired of failed actions
cluttering your GitHub Actions tab or want to ensure your workflows run smoothly before pushing to
GitHub, Act is definitely worth a try. Happy coding!
